### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

I started with the mobile design first to get all the cards lined up in the correct order. 
Then moved the functionality and getting the data to show. 
Moved back to the deisgn to make sure that the data for weekly was almost looking correct. 
Then proceed to the naviagtion buttons. Here I realised that I had to change the functinoality so I could see the different timeframes. Once this was completed. I started on the bigger screens. 
Here is where I ran into an issue. I realised that my grid and mobile set up was incorrect. 
I set up anouther small project and played around with grid until I got the basic look together. Then refactored my code and tweeked the styling to match the figma file.  

### Built with
